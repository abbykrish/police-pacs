# Police PAC Watch
Using http://transparencyusa.org/tx/, Ritvik and I found Police Department PACs donations to election campaigns across Texas. 

In 2019 alone, nearly half a million dollars were donated to campaigns for elected office across the Senate. Most of these are local, city-wide positions. This demonstrates the power many police departments have in election alone.  How can we expect our local Representatives, DAs and more to commit to police reform when they rely on their contribution? 

If you want to hold elected officials accountable to really showing that they believe that Black Lives Matter, email them to match their police campaign contributions towards organizations working to uplift black Americans.
